# GPSTime
iOS/macOS App for UTC/GPS Time Conversion

GPSTime is a precise time conversion tool designed for researchers, students, and GPS/GNSS professionals. Time conversion is a frequent challenge in GNSS work—whether parsing broadcast ephemerides, handling IGS product names, or aligning observation data. GPSTime streamlines this process by providing accurate conversions between GPS Time and UTC, with full support for leap seconds.

The app supports a wide range of commonly used formats, including:
	•	GPS Week + Time of Week (TOW)
	•	GPS Week + Day of Week (DOW)
	•	Gregorian calendar (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
	•	Year + Day of Year (DOY)
	•	Modified Julian Date (MJD)

Using historical leap-second data, GPSTime ensures correct handling of the GPS–UTC offset for both past and present times. GPSTime is also capable of saving your conversion history (up to 200 logs in the History tab) and lets you configure default conversion scenarios to match your most frequently used time system and format.

With a clean interface and multiple input/output options, GPSTime is an essential companion for GNSS research, education, and precise timekeeping tasks.
